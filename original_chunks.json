    "text": "Preface to the Fourth Edition, by Warren E. Buffett I read the first edition of this book early in 1950, when I was nine- teen. I thought then that it was by far the best book about investing ever written. I still think it is. To invest successfully over a lifetime does not require a strato- spheric IQ, unusual business insights, or inside information. What\u2019s needed is a sound intellectual framework for making deci- sions and the ability to keep emotions from corroding that frame- work. This book precisely and clearly prescribes the proper framework. You must supply the emotional discipline. If you follow the behavioral and business principles that Gra- ham advocates\u2014and if you pay special attention to the invaluable advice in Chapters 8 and 20\u2014you will not get a poor result from your investments. (That represents more of an accomplishment than you might think.) Whether you achieve outstanding results will depend on the effort and intellect you apply to your invest- ments, as well as on the amplitudes of stock-market folly that pre- vail during your investing career. The sillier the market\u2019s behavior, the greater the opportunity for the business-like investor. Follow Graham and you will profit from folly rather than participate in it. To me, Ben Graham was far more than an author or a teacher. More than any other man except my father, he influenced my life. Shortly after Ben\u2019s death in 1976, I wrote the following short remembrance about him in the Financial Analysts Journal. As you read the book, I believe you\u2019ll perceive some of the qualities I men- tioned in this tribute. viii"

    "text": "ix Preface to the Fourth Edition BENJAMIN GRAHAM 1894\u20131976 Several years ago Ben Graham, then almost eighty, expressed to a friend the thought that he hoped every day to do \u201csomething foolish, something creative and something generous.\u201d The inclusion of that first whimsical goal reflected his knack for pack- aging ideas in a form that avoided any overtones of sermonizing or self-importance. Although his ideas were powerful, their delivery was unfailingly gentle. Readers of this magazine need no elaboration of his achievements as measured by the standard of creativity. It is rare that the founder of a disci- pline does not find his work eclipsed in rather short order by successors. But over forty years after publication of the book that brought structure and logic to a disorderly and confused activity, it is difficult to think of pos- sible candidates for even the runner-up position in the field of security analysis. In an area where much looks foolish within weeks or months after publication, Ben\u2019s principles have remained sound\u2014their value often enhanced and better understood in the wake of financial storms that demolished flimsier intellectual structures. His counsel of soundness brought unfailing rewards to his followers\u2014even to those with natural abilities inferior to more gifted practitioners who stumbled while follow- ing counsels of brilliance or fashion. A remarkable aspect of Ben\u2019s dominance of his professional field was that he achieved it without that narrowness of mental activity that concen- trates all effort on a single end. It was, rather, the incidental by-product of an intellect whose breadth almost exceeded definition. Certainly I have never met anyone with a mind of similar scope. Virtually total recall, unending fascination with new knowledge, and an ability to recast it in a form applicable to seemingly unrelated problems made exposure to his thinking in any field a delight. But his third imperative\u2014generosity\u2014was where he succeeded beyond all others. I knew Ben as my teacher, my employer, and my friend. In each relationship\u2014just as with all his students, employees, and friends\u2014there was an absolutely open-ended, no-scores-kept generosity of ideas, time, and spirit. If clarity of thinking was required, there was no better place to go. And if encouragement or counsel was needed, Ben was there. Walter Lippmann spoke of men who plant trees that other men will sit under. Ben Graham was such a man. Reprinted from the Financial Analysts Journal, November/December 1976."

    "text": "5 LESSON 1: THE SEVEN GOLDEN RULES OF INVESTING W elcome Young Investors! It is our goal to make you master investors. Many of the lessons you will learn have been used by successful investors over several generations. You will notice that a recipe for success is easy to follow but is actually followed by few. Let\u2019s start with a question: ARE YOU AN INVESTOR? Are you a spender or an investor? Pop Quiz. Ready. Go. Question #1 I\u2019ll give you $100 today or a new Mercedes next year? Which one will you take? A) The cash B) The car C) Why are you even looking at other options, you\u2019d be crazy not to take the car! Question #2 I\u2019ll give you $100 today or $100 next year. Which one will you take? Think about it... A) The cash today B) The same cash tomorrow C) Of course you wouldn\u2019t wait! What\u2019s the point? You wouldn\u2019t get anything in return for waiting. In one minute we\u2019ve narrowed down whether you are an investor or a spender. You\u2019re a spender if you don\u2019t get a return. You\u2019re an investor if the future is worth somewhere between $100 and a new car. The question of whether you will invest is really just a question of how much you believe tomorrow can offer. How much could the future be worth for a bit of sacrifice today? That is the key question that every investor asks themselves\u2026. Introduction"

    "text": "7 SECTION 1 Who are Investors? T he truth is that WE ARE ALL investors. When we hear the word investors, we may think of a high-flying Wall-Street banker in a blue-pin striped suit. That is certainly one type of investor, but so is the business owner, the family trying to save for their kids\u2019 college, and the college student trying to scrape up enough quarters to eat dinner. We all need to manage the money we make, and we all hope to end up with as much money as possible. The question of building wealth in your life will really boil down to two questions? 1) Are you able to save each year? 2) When you save, where do you put the money? Hypothetical Let\u2019s assume you\u2019re 20 years old and just took a job as a fireman, your childhood dream (what kid doesn\u2019t want to be a fireman, right?). Your salary is meager, but you make the goal to save $1,000 dollars per year and put it in a retirement account. You work and save for the next 50 years until you retire. Does it really matter where I put that money, I mean it\u2019s only a thousand bucks a year? Well you have a couple of options, let\u2019s evaluate. 1). The savings Account (otherwise known as the \u201cUnder the Mattress\u201d approach). The easiest and \u201csafest\u201d thing is you could just put the money in cash. Nice and safe! It will never go away and it won\u2019t go up and down. Average Annual Return: 0% Amount Accumulated in 50 Years: $50,000 2). Bonds or Real Estate. Most people say that they get most of their retirement funds from investing in their home and watching it increase in value. Or investing in bonds. Both of these options will grow in line with inflation, which on average is about 3% per year. Average Annual Return: 3% Amount Accumulated in 50 Years: $116,000 YOUNG INVESTORS SOCIETY .

    "text": "8 3). The Stock Market. Scary, right? It goes up and down. There are times when it can decline by 20% in a short period of time, inducing panic and scary headlines. But over time, the stock market grows with how fast corporations grow. In every ten year period, the stock market earns you 8-10% returns. In fact, over the last century, the S&P 500 (the largest 500 companies in the US) have returned 9.8% per year. Average Annual Return: 9.8% Amount Accumulated in 50 Years: $1,359,199 So does it really matter where you put your money? Uh, yeah! It makes all the difference in the world. In fact, the more money that you can put in the stock market early, the more the magnifying effect of \u201ccompound interest\u201d or \u201ccompounding\u201d can work in your favor. \u201cCompound interest is the eighth wonder of the world\u201d -Albert Einstein Now, I know what you\u2019re thinking. If going from 3% to 10% return gets me an extra million dollars, what does getting a 20% return do? Warren Buffett, the legendary investor, for example earned 30% return over a period of 30 years. (called the famous \u201c30/30\u201d). 4). Beating the Market. This isn\u2019t easy, it isn\u2019t for everyone, but let\u2019s say you take a few hours per week, and you do your homework, and invest in some exceptional companies through the stock market, and earn an extraordinary 20% return per year. This is a very high return (even 12% per year is quite a feat) but let\u2019s just assume you\u2019re really good at finding great stocks. Average Annual Return: 20% Amount Accumulated in 50 Years: $109,826,119 (Yes, that\u2019s over $100 million dollars) That\u2019s a huge fortune for a fireman saving just $1k per year. So, now you know why you heard your dad\u2019s friend bragging that he \u201cbeat the market\u201d on his investment portfolio last year. The difference between 3% and 10% may seem small, but it makes all the difference in the world towards building wealth. Starting Early Compound interest is a powerful effect, and the EARLIER you start investing the more it will work for you. Consider the example above with the fireman, but instead of starting to save at 20 years old, instead he starts to save at 40 years old. Instead of retiring with $1.3 million he will retire with only YOUNG INVESTORS SOCIETY . STOCK INVESTING 101"

Look at the results below assuming he invests in the stock market: Started saving $1,000 per year at \u058d at Age 40 = $190,773 (at age 70) \u058d at Age 30 = $535,682 (at age 70) \u058d at Age 20 = $1,359,199 (at age 70) And then, let\u2019s say you join Young Investors Society and start investing when you\u2019re 15 years old. What does an extra 5 years get you? \u058d at Age 15 = $2,224,948 (at age 70) Notice that the difference is almost a million dollars difference if you start just 5 years earlier! In summary, the TWO CRITICAL FACTORS of COMPOUND INTEREST are: 5). Earn a High Return (i.e. the stock market) 6). Start Early And remember, we\u2019re all investors, whether we like it or not!

The following link is a great video explaining a \u201cstock\u201d and the \u201cstock market\u201d, please review Lesson 1 (What is the Stock Market) and Lesson 2 (What are Stocks) done by our partner, Wall Street Survivor. https://younginvestorssociety.org/videos/stock-market-101/ You can see from this that investing in the stock market is \u201cserious business,\u201d at the same time it can be a fun game.

    "text": "10 All companies have owners. A small company started by a single individual may have only him or her as the single owner. The large corporations that have stock (shares that are traded by the general public) have many owners. To simplify and organize the buying and selling of these shares by the general public, companies use the stock market. In fact, US government regulations require that a company, once it reaches a certain number of owners, must go public. This is to allow its now large number of owners to be able to buy and sell their shares of stock in the company more easily. Just think about it this way. Let\u2019s pretend that your sibling or a close friend is starting a small company. He or she is doing really well, but needs more money (capital) to expand. He or she asks you to become a part owner in the business by investing some of your savings. You agree. Would you try to sell your ownership in the company just a few days later? Most likely not! It should be the same thing when you decide to buy a public company\u2019s stock. The only real difference is that your sibling\u2019s or friend\u2019s company is a private company with just two shareholders, whereas there are many more owners in a public company with shares in the \u201cstock market.\u201d \u201cWithout a saving faith in the future, no one would ever invest at all. To be an investor, you must be a believer in a better tomorrow\u201d Benjamin Graham ACTIVITY: FIND THE STOCK Investing in a stock is buying a piece of the company. Search the internet to match the brands with the company (stock) that owns it.
